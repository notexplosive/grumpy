# Why?

I like the YouTube channel Game Grumps, if you've somehow stumbled into this strange corner of the internet, chances are you do too.

Due to YouTube's algorithm statistically favoring videos with more "clickbaity" titles, Game Grumps has been forced to adapt, meaning more and more of their video titles are lengthy and clickbaity, often leaving important information (such as the game being played and the episode number) to the very end, which often gets ellided away.

Enter: Grumpy!

Grumpy looks at the title of each Game Grumps video and replaces it with just the last part. Here are some examples:

`BATTLING our DEMONS Lmao - Doom` becomes just `Doom`
`What is it like to GO on a DATE?! FIND OUT INSIDE! - Sakura Santa: PART FOUR` becomes `Sakura Santa: PART FOUR`

It's simple (which is why I wrote it) but also extremely effective. My Game Grumps viewing experience has improved immensely since I wrote this extension.

# How to install

Installing an unpacked chrome extension is easy!

- Download or clone this repo, so that you have a folder with all of the source files in it (not a zip!)
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in chrome
- Click the "Developer Mode" switch in the top right
- Click `Load Unpacked` in the top left
- Navigate to the folder that has `manifest.json`
- Click `Select Folder`

You should now see the icon in the top right in grayscale. It will become colorful when you visit YouTube.

# Usage

Simply having the extension installed allows it to work its magic on YouTube. You'll see certain Game Grumps videos suddenly have an orage title, that means the extension did something to them.

If you want to turn off Grumpy, click on the icon while on a YouTube video, and click `Turn off`. You will need to refresh for it to fully take effect.
