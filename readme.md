# How to install

Installing an unpacked chrome extension is easy!

- Download or clone this repo, so that you have a folder with all of the source files in it (not a zip!)
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in chrome
- Click the "Developer Mode" switch in the top right
- Click `Load Unpacked` in the top left
- Navigate to the folder that has `manifest.json`
- Click `Select Folder`

You should now see the icon in the top right in grayscale. It will become colorful when you visit YouTube.

# Usage

Simply having the extension installed allows it to work its magic on YouTube. You'll see certain Game Grumps videos suddenly have an orage title, that means the extension did something to them.

If you want to turn off Grumpy, click on the icon while on a YouTube video, and click `Turn off`. You will need to refresh for it to fully take effect.
